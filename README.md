# Fin PEN (Financial Payment Elevation Network):

Fin PEN is an AI powered blockchain DApp built to convert real-world business contracts into tamper-proof smart contracts. 

You can call FinPEN the "Poor person's contract Lawyer."

<br/>

## System Design:

A client takes a photo of a real-world business contract and uploads it to the app. The app's image processing AI captures the contract's data and the data captured is added to Chainlink's blockchain as a smart contract.

## Uploading a Business Contract:

Now let’s analyze a business contract.

Take a photo of an business contract, (or use one of these [demo receipts](/demos/)) and upload it to Fin PEN for analysis.

Fin PEN will start processing the contract (this could take several minutes).

The Fin PEN app will capture the contract's data, analyse the results and plot a graph displaying the results of the analysis.

The Fin PEN Graph of the analysis will look like below.
